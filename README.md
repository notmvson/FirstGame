<h2 id="about">About the Project</h2>
<p> The website link to this project can be found here. The aim of this project was to practice my javascript knowledge and attempt to learn new features along the way. This is my first attempt at creating a game.</p>
<p> This project is intended to be the culmination of knowledge from my Dev209: ClientSide Web Program class and was created as a final project.</p>

<h2 id="builtWith">Built With</h2>
<p>This project was built using the following technologies and languages</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="futureFeatures">Future Features</h2>
<p>In the future, I am considering creating the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Difficulty Modes - I want to allow the user to be able to toggle the difficulty of the game.</li>
  <li>Screen Size - I want the website to fit correctly with any screen size, and able to change layout if the screen is minimised.</li>
</ul>
